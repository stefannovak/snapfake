# snapfake

Snapfake is my ongoing project, a clone of Snapchat created in August 2020. I started this project as a test of my own skills, with the main goals of:

Incorporating Firebase into my project
Using the BLoC architecture
Using the camera functionality in Flutter

As of 02/09/20:

Users are fully Firebase authenticated.
The chat screen is almost finished:
  Just need to keep the new added friends on the screen after leaving the screen.
  correctly display the users/logged in user messages on a screen.
  
BLoCs have been attempted but need more work
Camera functionality needs to be refined
